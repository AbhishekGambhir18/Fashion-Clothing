# Fashion-Clothing
We're using the Fashion Clothing dataset to explore image classification techniques. We'll use VGG16 to extract features and then apply PCA for dimensionality reduction. We'll compare the performance of neural networks trained on original and PCA-transformed features to evaluate classification accuracy.
